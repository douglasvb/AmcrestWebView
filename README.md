# AmcrestWebView
A simple way to make a static image for the latest uploaded image from an AmCrest IP camera.  Use this code to find the latest image, overwrite a static image with the latest image, and do it all pretty quickly.

Code was based on the code that SpareVolts shared with me previously.  Original code is available here: https://github.com/SpareVolts/AmcrestWebView
