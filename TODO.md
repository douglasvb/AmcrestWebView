ToDo list:

- Detect latest file type and only do image copy if it is a specific file type
- Only allow a refresh of the image once a minute.  This is important if we start getting a lot of people looking at the server.
- Look into waiting a second for an image to load with the wordpress HTML.  Might need to make a plugin or something to do that?  Maybe could do it via PHP with the way the image is returned from the other server?
